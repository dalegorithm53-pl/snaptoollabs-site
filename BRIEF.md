# SnapTool Labs — Landing Page Brief

## Company
SnapTool Labs builds lightweight, privacy-first browser extensions that turn everyday tasks into one-click actions. No accounts. No cloud uploads. Everything runs locally in your browser.

## Products
- **SnapText** — Instant OCR. Screenshot any text on screen and get editable, copyable text in seconds.
- **SnapPDF** — A full PDF toolkit. Merge, split, rotate, compress, and convert — without uploading a single file.

## Requirements
Build a single-page landing page (index.html + CSS, no frameworks) with THREE distinct color scheme/logo options. Each option should be a separate HTML file:
- `option-a.html` — Modern/tech (think dark mode, electric accents)
- `option-b.html` — Clean/minimal (white space, subtle colors, professional)
- `option-c.html` — Bold/playful (bright, energetic, stands out)

## Page Sections
1. Hero with logo/wordmark + tagline
2. Brief "What we build" section with SnapText + SnapPDF cards
3. "Why SnapTool Labs?" — privacy-first, no accounts, runs locally, lightweight
4. Simple footer with placeholder links (Privacy, Terms, Contact)

## Design Constraints
- Single HTML file per option (inline CSS or embedded <style>)
- Must be responsive (mobile + desktop)
- No JavaScript required (static content)
- No external dependencies (fonts can use Google Fonts CDN)
- Each option needs a distinct text-based logo/wordmark for "SnapTool Labs"
- Make it feel premium — this is a brand launch, not a prototype
- 1584px max content width

## Inspiration
Think Linear, Vercel, Raycast — clean, confident, developer-friendly aesthetics.
